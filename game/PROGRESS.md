# Grovewatch: Sanctuary Siege — Progress

An original tower-defense + village-building game. The **Keepers of the Grove** defend their
woodland sanctuary from the **Murkhorde**, bog critters creeping out of the Gloomfen.
Resources: **Coins** (battle currency / village gold) and **Glowsap** (the second village resource, planned).

Run: `npm run dev` · Build: `npm run build` · Tests: `npm test` · Smoke test + screenshots: `npm run build && node scripts/screenshot.mjs <name>`

Iteration counter: **4** (next iteration = 5 → POLISH + BALANCE pass)

## Done
- [x] **Iter 1** — Project scaffold (Vite + TS + Phaser 3 + Vitest), procedural textures, WebAudio SFX.
  Renderer-free `BattleSim` (paths, waves, towers, projectiles, splash/slow support, armor/magic resist,
  4 targeting modes, early-call bonus, win/lose). Level 1 *Mossgate Meadow* (8 waves), 2 towers
  (Thornbow Nest, Glimmer Spire, 3 tiers each), 3 enemies (Mudling, Skitter, Shellback).
  Battle HUD (lives/coins/wave, call wave, pause, speed x1/x2/x3), radial build/upgrade/sell/aim menu,
  hit flash, damage numbers, particles, screen shake on leak, victory/defeat panel with stars saved to localStorage.
  Headless Playwright smoke test script.
- [x] **Iter 2** — All 4 base tower types. **Boulder Bellows** (artillery: lobbed rocks that aim ahead of
  the target, splash damage, can't hit flyers, arc rendering, dust ring + small shake) and **Burrow Den**
  (barracks: squads of Badger Wardens that walk to a rally point on the road, block and brawl with ground
  enemies, take damage, die, respawn, heal when idle; tap "Rally Point" then the road to move them).
  Enemies now have melee stats. 4-option radial build menu. 7 new unit tests (30 total).
- [x] **Iter 3** — Enemy roster expanded to **12 types**: Gloomwing + Bog Gnat (flying: soldiers and
  artillery can't touch them; drawn high with a ground shadow), Bogmender (healer aura), Reedguard
  (reed shield absorbs damage first), Splotch (splits into 2 Mudlings), Thornhog (fast + armored),
  Wispling (70% magic resist), Bog Brute (tank that hits soldiers hard), and the boss **Old Murkmaw**
  with 3 phases (summons Mudlings → mud shell + healers → enrage speed). Boss HUD bar with phase ticks
  and shield, boss arrival/phase banners + shake, heal/shield-break/split effects. New level 2
  **Gloomfen Edge** (2 merging roads, 12 waves, boss finale). Banners moved under the HUD so they
  don't cover the battlefield; oversized map background so shake doesn't show edges.
  `scripts/showcase-enemies.mjs` visual check. 6 new tests (36 total).
- [x] **Iter 4** — **Heroes.** 3 heroes in `data/heroes.ts`: **Bramble** the Badger Knight (melee
  blocker; passive Thick Hide; active Earthshake = ground AoE + slow), **Fen** the Heron Ranger (ranged,
  hits air; passive 25% crits; active Feather Storm = volley at 8 targets), **Ember** the Fox Sage
  (magic; passive Warm Glow = nearby towers +20% fire rate; active Foxfire Ring = AoE burn + slow).
  Tap the hero (or portrait / H) then tap the map to move; skill button (or Q) with cooldown pie.
  XP from kills (full nearby, 35% far), levels 1–6 (+12% stats/level), death + respawn timer.
  Hero picker on the menu (saved). Smoke scripts now start battles via the Menu scene (old way left
  the menu running underneath and its buttons swallowed clicks). 8 new tests (44 total).

## In Progress
- (none)

## Backlog (ranked)
1. Global spells: Starfall (meteor AoE) + Call the Rangers (temporary soldiers), cooldowns.
2. World map scene with level nodes, star totals, unlock progression; levels 2–5.
3. Tower top-tier specializations (2 branches per tower).
4. Home base (village) scene: grid, Town Hall, Coin Mine, Glowsap Well, Storage, builders, timed upgrades; campaign rewards feed the village.
5. Village buildings grant battle perks (e.g. Defense Workshop unlocks/boosts towers).
6. Levels 6–15+, multi-path levels.
7. Raid mode: AI villages, train troops in Barracks, deploy to attack.
8. Meta: achievements, daily challenge, encyclopedia, settings scene (volume / mute).
9. Mobile polish: larger touch targets, pinch-free layout, orientation hint.
10. Ambient music loop (procedural).

## Known Bugs
- (none known)

## Ideas parked
- Persistent hero levels across battles (meta progression) — currently levels reset each battle.

## Balance Notes
- Level 2 (Gloomfen Edge) untuned and probably hard — boss has 2400 hp. Check in iteration 5.
- Level 1 untuned. First real pass scheduled for iteration 5 (headless sim harness to be written then).
